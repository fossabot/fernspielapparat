# reproduces issue #18, where a symbol causes a transition from
# quiet to the talk state and immediately progresses to the next state.
# every symbol should only be handled once.
# derived from a file provided by thomas, with pause being marked as terminal
# and states being renamed from UUIDs to something more descriptive.
# also removed the timeout after zero seconds, which distracted a bit from the core problem
